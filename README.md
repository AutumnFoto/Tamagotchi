# Tamagotchi 2.0

![](2020-10-03%2020_36_20-.png)

## Description
This project was our first opportunity to practice using JavaScript modules along with Webpack and SASS. The original Tamagotchi toy was a handheld device in the 90s, with an app that allowed the user to care for a digital pet. Our app is similar to the original Tamagotchi app, allowing the user to view four different areas of overall health and see the impact when different buttons are clicked.

### Feature List
The user can increase or descrease the Tamagotchi's overall health with four different actions:
- Eat
- Play
- Fight
- Sleep

## Tech Used
* SASS
* HTML
* JS with ES6 modules
* jQuery
* Webpack configuration
